This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About
This is a simple react (eventually going to be a react-redux) boilerplate that can be used to initiate a new React project without having to install the usual libraries/packages repeatedly every time. As I add more libraries/packages, I will keep updating the below list.

## List of libraries/packages added to the boilerplate
### React Router
The first package I've added is the React Router package using:
```
yarn add react-router-dom
```
I have also added a couple of Routes (`/home` and `/about`) and a Redirect to the `/home` route for any other value.
